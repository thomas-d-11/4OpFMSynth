# 4OpFMSynth
Polyphonic, 4 Operator, Frequency Modulation Synthesizer


These files are for use with the Axoloti project board (http://www.axoloti.com/, https://github.com/axoloti/axoloti).
AxoFiles/patches/fm synth is the main patch file that needs to be loaded onto the Axoloti board. The other files in 
AxoFiles/patches/, and the files in AxoFiles/objects/, are necessary for compiling AxoFiles/patches/fm synth onto the
Axoloti board.


Current State (as of Sept. 30, 2018): Alpha. Code has been debugged within the Axoloti IDE, and core functionality
within AxoFiles/patches/fm operator and ~/fm voice seem to be working properly. ~/fm synth is untested. The case 
and controls hardware is currently being fabricated.
